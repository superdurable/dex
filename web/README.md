# Dex Web

The live Flow overview lists pending Channel messages with their server-assigned
IDs and decoded values. Operators can delete a pending message. Temporal performs
the deletion atomically; the Cadence query-plus-signal fallback is best effort and
can race message consumption.

Flow Definition Graphs show resource-read edges for AttributeMap and Channel
message snapshots explicitly selected by Python RPC decorators. Channel size
metadata does not add a resource-read edge because every RPC receives it.

Dex Web searches flows and displays Dex semantic history, step topology,
live flow state, time travel points, and stop controls.

The production Web server is Go. It serves an embedded React SPA and translates
same-origin HTTP/JSON requests under `/api/` to Dex `FlowService` gRPC calls.
Temporal/Cadence credentials and backend history never enter the browser.

`GetHistoryEvents` returns the same `input`, `output`, and `context` step-event
shape for sync, async, and async-fallback execution. Timeline, Execution graph,
Time Travel and Selected event use that common structure.

`POST /api/blobs/load` batches Dex `LoadBlobs` calls. The browser recursively
hydrates the selected event and current flow state, dedupes by blob kind and ID,
and caches loaded values across tabs. Missing values are labeled
`Value blob unavailable`. Terminal async failures without a retained invocation
snapshot explain the short-retry behavior in Selected event without raising a
page-level data warning. Neither state exposes blob IDs or storage paths.

## Run through dexcli

```bash
dexcli dev
```

Open [http://127.0.0.1:8802](http://127.0.0.1:8802). No Node.js process runs in
this mode.

To load Flow Definition Graph JSON files into the independent **Flow Rendering**
page, provide a directory at startup:

```bash
dexcli dev --flow-rendering-dir ./build/flow-definitions
```

Without an `active-manifest`, Dex recursively scans JSON files on every
definition-dependent request. Generate them with `dexcli visualize SOURCE
--json --out ./build/flow-definitions/name`; changes become visible without a
Dex Web restart. Invalid JSON, unsupported schema versions, and source read
failures return a typed 503 and make `/readyz` fail.

Starting Dex with `--flow-rendering-dir` opens **v2** at `/v2`. The top-right
Version menu returns to **v1**. Without that directory, Dex Web opens **v1** at
`/v1/flows`. v2 lists current runs for one Flow type on the left and renders
that type's Flow Definition Graph on the right. A Flow with no Steps renders
one card per RPC. Each card lists the Attributes the RPC reads and writes and
the Channels it publishes to. Action RPCs show their Action label and required
permission, and Summary and Display RPCs are marked as views. Run lists omit
executions closed by continue-as-new. Summary, Display, edits, and
Actions target the current run without accepting a Run ID. Version 1 and
Version 2 files can coexist. Each definition's Flow type is the one Workers
register, so Go Flows need no `GetFlowType` or `GetStepType` override unless
`dexcli visualize` reports a Flow or Step name diagnostic.
Duplicate valid Version 2 definitions for one Flow type, such as two
package-main Flows named `main.Flow`, make the definition source invalid, and
the error names both files. Invalid analyzer output remains visible on **v1** Flow
Rendering but does not appear as a **v2** Flow type.

### Start Flow

The v2 Run workspace shows **Start Flow** when the selected definition contains
a `v2.start` schema and `web.workQueuePermissionMode` is `local-selector`. The
dialog asks for a Flow ID, a plaintext Worker gRPC address, and the generated
start input. It recursively renders objects, arrays, string-key maps, enums,
booleans, datetime values, optional fields, and nullable fields. Integer input
stays as decimal text until the request is serialized, so int64 values do not
pass through JavaScript floating-point numbers.

Dex Web checks the Worker `host:port` from the BFF when the address loses focus
and again before starting. An unreachable port shows a warning and blocks the
start until the operator explicitly selects **Bypass worker health check**.
The probe opens a TCP connection and does not invoke a Worker method.

`POST /api/v2/start` accepts `flowType`, `flowId`, `workerTargetAddress`, and the
raw JSON `input`. It also accepts `bypassWorkerHealthCheck`; false performs the
server-side port check and returns `WORKER_UNHEALTHY` with HTTP 412 when the
target is unreachable. `POST /api/v2/worker-health` checks the same address for
the dialog. Start requires `X-Dex-Flow-Definition-Revision`, reloads the current
definition snapshot, validates every input field again, and rejects unknown
fields. The Server chooses the start Step type and generates the request ID. It derives
`skipWaitFor` from the validated graph's Start Step phase: `execute` starts at
Execute, while `wait_for+execute` retains WaitFor. Missing, repeated, or unknown
Start phases are invalid definitions; the browser cannot supply Step options.
The browser cannot set Worker headless routing.

Configure headless routing once for every Flow started from this Dex Web
instance:

```yaml
web:
  startFlowWorkerTargetHeadless: false
```

The equivalent environment variable is
`DEX_WEB_START_FLOW_WORKER_TARGET_HEADLESS`. The default is false and the value
is immutable after startup. Set it to true when the entered Worker addresses
are Kubernetes headless Service targets. In `trusted-header` mode, Start Flow requires the authenticated embedding
metadata described below; browsers cannot select Worker targets.

The v2 Work Queue is available at `/v2/work-queue`. In the default
`local-selector` mode, its **Working as** control
selects one Action permission and filters on the Server-maintained
`DexWorkQueuePermissions` Search Attribute. The Worker submits the complete
Action permission mapping only when an invocation writes an Action condition
source. Dex Web submits the same mapping only when `SetAttributes` edits one of
those sources. The Server overlays the writes on authoritative Attribute state
and atomically adds newly matching permissions to the projection. Once added,
a permission remains searchable for that Flow execution. `POST
/api/v2/search` also accepts several `workQueuePermissions`; they are matched
with OR, then combined with the Flow type and other filters using AND. This
selector is a local development boundary. In hosted deployments,
`trusted-header` hides the selector, ignores request-body permissions, and
authorizes Search and Actions only from
`X-Dex-Work-Queue-Permissions`. A trusted reverse proxy must strip any
client-supplied value before injecting its own. Port 8802 must not be reachable
around that proxy.
Dex does not expose an `/api/v2/access` endpoint; hosted identity and role
resolution stay in the reverse proxy and hosting control plane.

Hosted Start Flow requires the private trusted proxy to inject `flows.start`,
the authenticated actor, a fixed Worker target and an instance-bound target
revision. The form shows only FDG business inputs and creates stable Flow and
operation IDs. A lost response is reconciled against that original identity
through `/api/v2/start/recover`. See the English and Chinese Dex Web production
documentation for the complete header, CSRF, schema and recovery contract.

Official embedding releases are reproducible source archives. Run
`python3 script/release/package_embedded_web.py dex-web-v2 0.3.0 --output /tmp/dex-packages`
and the corresponding `flow-definition-renderer 0.2.0` command to reproduce
the tagged artifacts. Start Flow sources, types and CSS are part of the
import closure; aliases become package-relative imports during packaging.

The local v2 Connectors page is available at `/v2/connectors` when Dex Web
runs through loopback-bound `dexcli dev` with a local Flow Definition source.
`/v2/connections` redirects there and keeps its sub-path, query, and hash.
The page uses the Run and Work Queue layout: a resizable
sidebar lists the named connections, and the selected one's setup fills the
main panel. The **Local store** zone at the bottom of the main panel shows the
store directory, the file names inside it, and the launch command, with
**Copy** buttons that copy the absolute values. In project mode the zone shows the configuration status and
revisions instead. The page follows the Dex Web theme.

The page groups Connector Steps by Connector ID and static connection name,
resolves the exact official Connector release declared by the graph, verifies
release and Studio UI checksums, and loads UI bundles in opaque-origin sandbox
iframes. Each connection view in `GET /api/v2/connector-connections` carries
`displayName`, the release manifest's `metadata.displayName`, from a local
override or a verified official release in local and project mode. Verified
release metadata is cached in memory for the process, and the list waits at
most five seconds for uncached metadata. Without release metadata the field is
omitted, and the page names the Connector by its ID. The connection name is
shown beside it as **Connection** *name*.
Without a Studio bundle, it renders the manifest fields directly. The generic
form renders a connector-owned authorization guide with an external provider
link and ordered setup steps. Fields that require user input appear first. Fields
that can be omitted or use manifest defaults remain visible under **Optional
settings**. Every non-secret manifest default appears below its field in
parentheses; leaving that input blank uses the displayed default. URLs in field
guidance are clickable.

During Connector development, the repeatable
`--connector-release-override connector-id=artifact-directory` flag on
`dexcli dev` can replace release resolution for selected Connector IDs. This
allows Flow graphs produced from `go.work` modules to use the local release
metadata and Studio UI. Connectors labels these sessions as **Local
override**. Overrides are accepted only by loopback local Connector setup and
retain the normal metadata, checksum, Host API, and safe-archive validation.

The setup tabs expand vertically below the selected named connection. They put
authorization first and disable every Flow configuration until the connection
is ready. Each Connector Step or Trigger binding that declares
`ConfigurationUI` gets one tab. Dex Web mounts only the selected tab's
sandboxed unit iframes and marks the tab configured after its scoped record has
been saved. The Connector bundle renders only the small pickers and inputs and
reports bounded content heights through a nonce-bound `connector.frame.resize`
message. Dex Web validates the message source and resizes each iframe without
reading its opaque-origin DOM. Unit ports are merged at their declared JSON
Pointers, so Flow code controls composition without coupling a Connector's
connection screen to one example. The host protocol for this contract is 0.2.

A release with several `spec.auth.methods` normally selects one of them. With
`spec.auth.selection: multiple`, one connection holds a non-empty subset of the
methods, such as several model providers. The form then shows one card per
added method, with its guide, credential fields, and configuration fields, and
a Remove button. An Add menu lists the methods not yet added. The section
title and menu use `spec.auth.methodLabel`, such as **Providers** and **Add
provider**; without it they read **Authentication methods**. Save needs at
least one method. A method's `configuration.fields` are non-secret fields that
are validated, and required, only while that method is selected.

The connection write sends `authMethodId` for single selection or
`authMethodIds`, in add order, for multiple selection. Dex Web stamps the
selection into the stored credentials as `auth_method` or `auth_methods`, a
JSON string array. A request that sets either name in `credentials` is
rejected with `CONNECTOR_REQUEST_INVALID`. Configuration is validated against
`spec.configuration.fields` plus the selected methods' configuration fields.
Credentials are validated against the selected methods' fields, and each
method's required fields must be present. Each write replaces the stored
record, so removing a method drops its credential and configuration fields.

Editing a connection prefills its stored non-secret configuration. Stored
credential values are never returned. The connection view lists their names in
`storedCredentialFields`, and the form shows each stored field as **Stored -
leave blank to keep**. A blank stored field is sent in `keepCredentialFields`.
Dex Web copies each listed field from the stored record only when that record
exists, the field belongs to a selected method, and the request does not also
set it. Any other name is a `CONNECTOR_REQUEST_INVALID` error. OAuth methods
still authorize again with new client credentials.

A `spec.configuration.fields` entry with `studioUnit: {unit, port}` renders
that Studio unit inline once the connection is Ready. Before that, the form
shows a note to save the connection first. A required field without a default
stays a plain input, so the first save can succeed. The frame target is
`{kind: "connection", unitId, bindings: [{port, jsonPointer: "/<field>"}],
value: {<field>: stored}}`. A `use.configuration.save` from it writes the
connection again with the current methods, the stored configuration merged
with the new value, and every stored credential field of the selected methods
in `keepCredentialFields`.

The `connector.host.ready` message also carries three optional fields. `theme` is
the theme the frame paints, `light` or `dark`. Dex Web sends the theme the page
paints. When the Dex Web theme changes, it sends every loaded frame a new ready
message, and the bundle repaints in place. It also sets the iframe element's
`color-scheme` to the same theme, because a frame whose scheme differs from its
element gets an opaque canvas. `themeTokens` is a flat map from `--studio-*` CSS
custom property names to values. Dex Web reads each value from an allowlisted
v2 token in `app/v2/css/tokens.css`, resolved from the ramps of the sent theme,
so a Dex Web restyle reaches every bundle without a Connector release. The
`:root` and `:root[data-theme='dark']` defaults in the stylesheet below match
those light and dark ramps, and `connectorStudioTheme.test.ts` checks that they
stay equal.

Each value must match one grammar, which `sdk/react` in dex-connectors-library
applies too:

- Colors are `#` with 3, 4, 6, or 8 hex digits, `rgb(R, G, B)`, or
  `rgba(R, G, B, A)`, in comma syntax. Channels are integers from 0 to 255
  without leading zeros. Alpha is 0 to 1 with at most four decimals.
- Radii are `0` or a non-negative `px` length with at most three digits on
  each side of the decimal point.
- `--studio-focus-ring` is one box shadow: an optional `inset`, two to four
  `px` lengths that may be negative, and one color.
- `--studio-duration` is up to four digits of `ms`, or seconds with at most two
  integer digits and three decimals, such as `160ms` or `.16s`.
- A font stack has 1 to 16 comma-separated families. A family is a quoted name
  of letters, digits, spaces, and hyphens, or unquoted words that each start
  with a letter, optionally after one hyphen. The CSS-wide keywords, `default`,
  and `none` are accepted only when quoted.
- A value is at most 256 characters.

Dex Web drops any other value, and the bundle keeps its built-in value for that
property.

`stylesheet` is the whole Connector Studio stylesheet: layout, spacing,
component rules, and the default token values for `light` and `dark`. Its only
source is `app/v2/connectors/connectorStudio.css`. Dex Web imports that file as
text with Vite's `?raw` suffix, removes its comments, and sends the result in
every ready message along with `theme` and `themeTokens`. A bundle built with
`sdk/react` replaces its compiled `connectorStudioStyles` with this text and
then applies `themeTokens` on top. A restyle of any Studio rule is therefore a
Dex Web change only. The compiled copy in `sdk/react` is the fallback for hosts
that omit the field, so a restyle does not need to change it. Only new markup
or new classes need a Connector release.

Bundles render only the `studio-*` class contract, which `sdk/react` exports as
`connectorStudioClassNames`: `studio-surface`, `studio-header`, `studio-muted`,
`studio-field`, `studio-actions`, `studio-button`, `studio-button-primary`,
`studio-notice`, `studio-notice-info`, `studio-notice-success`,
`studio-notice-error`, `studio-notice-attention`, `studio-options`,
`studio-option`, `studio-option-label`, `studio-option-id`,
`studio-option-detail`, `studio-badges`, `studio-badge`, and `studio-checkbox`.
The sent stylesheet must style every class in the contract and no other
`studio-*` class. It must also follow these rules:

- It is printable ASCII and at most 65,536 characters. It never contains `</`,
  so it cannot close the frame's `<style>` element. A bundle ignores a longer
  stylesheet or one containing `</`, and keeps its compiled one.
- It has a `.studio-<name>` selector for every class in the contract. A bundle
  also ignores a stylesheet that lacks a selector for any class in the
  `connectorStudioClassNames` it was built with. Renaming or dropping a class
  in `connectorStudio.css` therefore sends every released bundle back to its
  compiled stylesheet, and those bundles miss every later restyle until their
  connectors are released again. Keep every class, and add new ones only.
- It has no at-rules such as `@import` or `@media`, no comments, no backslash
  escapes, no `!important`, and no `url()` or `expression()`.
- A selector is a `:root` or `:root[data-theme='dark']` token block, `html`,
  `body`, or starts with a `studio-*` class. Element names, attribute
  selectors, and the `:hover`, `:focus-visible`, `:focus-within`, `:disabled`,
  `:checked`, and `:not()` pseudo-classes appear only after that class.
- Token blocks declare only `color-scheme` and the allowlisted `--studio-*`
  properties, and every value matches the `themeTokens` grammar. `:root`
  declares every allowlisted property.
- Every other declaration uses only numbers with `px`, `fr`, `%`, `ms`, or
  `s`, `var()` references to allowlisted properties without fallbacks, and the
  layout keywords the test lists. No other function is allowed, and the only
  color keyword on that list is `transparent`, so every other color comes
  from a token. Named colors such as `red` and `currentcolor` are rejected.

`themeTokens` are inline properties on the frame's root element, so they
outrank the stylesheet's token blocks. `!important` is banned because it
would reverse that. `connectorStudioTheme.test.ts` checks every rule above.
Vitest replaces CSS imports with empty strings, so `vite.config.ts` lets
`connectorStudio.css?raw` through for those tests.

Bundles that ignore the fields keep their built-in theme and stylesheet.

The ready message's `connection` also carries `authMethodIds` and
`configuration` for every frame: Step units, Trigger units, and connection
field units. `authMethodIds` lists the added methods in add order. A
single-selection connection reports its one method, or an empty list when the
release declares no methods. `configuration` is the stored non-secret
configuration. The protocol version stays 0.2.0.

Provider resource reads use release-declared Studio commands. The manifest
pins an HTTPS GET URL, a credential field and scheme, fixed query values,
optional fixed headers, and the only path or query parameters the iframe may
supply. The `bearer` scheme sends `Authorization: Bearer <secret>`. The
`header` scheme sends the raw secret in one named header, such as
`x-goog-api-key`. `fixedHeaders` holds non-secret values such as
`anthropic-version: 2023-06-01`.

Header names must be RFC 7230 tokens. Dex Web compares them
case-insensitively and treats `_` as `-`, because CGI-style servers merge the
two. They cannot be `Authorization`, `Accept`, `Host`, `Content-Length`,
`Transfer-Encoding`, `Connection`, `Keep-Alive`, `TE`, `Trailer`, `Upgrade`,
`Cookie`, `Set-Cookie`, `Origin`, `Referer`, `Forwarded`, `Proxy-*`,
`X-Forwarded-*`, `X-HTTP-Method`, `X-HTTP-Method-Override`, or
`X-Method-Override`. A fixed header cannot repeat the credential header or
another fixed header. Its value must be 1-256 printable ASCII characters
without leading or trailing spaces and must not contain the credential.

Dex Web checks each command's declaration before it sends that command's
request. A command with an unknown credential scheme or an invalid header
fails with `502`, and nothing is sent. The rest of the release still works:
saving credentials, OAuth, UI sessions, and the release's other commands. A
local release override with an invalid declaration fails when Dex Web starts.

Dex Web's generic broker validates the active session and capability, injects
the credential, sends `Accept: application/json`, bounds a JSON-object
response, and rejects responses containing credential material in any JSON
string or object key. It removes spaces around the stored credential before
sending it, because HTTP drops them on the wire, and it checks responses for
the value it sent. The credential must be printable ASCII.
Provider pagination, filtering, and response projection stay in the
Connector-owned UI bundle; Dex Web contains no provider-specific adapters.

A failed command reaches the iframe as a `connector.command.result` with
`ok: false`. Only the Connector UI shows a failed `provider.command.execute`.
This includes a provider error, a missing credential, and a Dex Web rejection
such as an expired UI session. A failed `use.configuration.save`, such as one
with a stale Flow Definition revision, also appears in the page error banner.
An unsupported command is reported only to the Connector UI.

Connections persist in `$HOME/.dex/connectors/connections.json` by default.
Use `--connector-config-dir` to select another directory. Restarting Dex Web
reloads the file and cached artifacts. OAuth state, PKCE verifier, client
secret, and UI session nonce remain memory-only and are discarded on restart.
The page displays the exact OAuth Redirect URI before authorization. A release
may derive required non-secret credentials from a declared HTTPS identity
endpoint; Dex accepts a derived claim only after any declared boolean
verification claim is true, and does not render a duplicate input.
The **Local store** zone shows the JSON file inside the store directory and
the `DEX_CONNECTOR_CONFIG_FILE=... <your-app-command>` launch command, and
**Copy** copies each absolute value. It never returns credential values. Deleting a local credential does not revoke the
provider grant.

Dex Web exchanges the authorization code at the release's `tokenEndpoint`. It
accepts any 2xx JSON response without an `error` field. The grant must include
every requested scope. A `scope` string in the response lists the granted
scopes, separated by spaces or commas. Without `scope`, Dex Web reads a
`scopes` string array, which HubSpot returns. A response with neither field
grants the requested scopes, as RFC 6749 section 5.1 allows. A non-empty
`refresh_token` also proves `offline_access`, and a non-empty `id_token` proves
`openid`. The Microsoft identity platform leaves both out of `scope`. A grant
that lacks a requested scope fails with `CONNECTOR_OAUTH_SCOPE_INSUFFICIENT`.
Requested `userScopes` are checked against Slack's `authed_user` object the
same way. An `authed_user` without either field must carry an `access_token`.

Two optional `oauth2` fields shape the code exchange request.
`tokenRequestEncoding` is `form`, the default, or `json`. `form` sends
`application/x-www-form-urlencoded`. `json` sends one JSON object of string
parameters, as Atlassian and Zendesk document. `tokenEndpointAuthMethod` uses
the RFC 7591 names `client_secret_post`, the default, and
`client_secret_basic`. `client_secret_post` sends `client_id` and
`client_secret` in the body. `client_secret_basic` sends them only as HTTP
Basic credentials, as Zoom, Calendly, and Notion document. Dex Web encodes
`client_id:client_secret` without form-encoding either value first. Any
other value fails OAuth start with `CONNECTOR_RELEASE_INVALID`, before the
browser leaves for the provider.

`scopes` may be empty for providers such as Help Scout and Notion that define
no OAuth scopes. Dex Web then omits the `scope` authorization parameter,
requires no granted scope, and does not list requested scopes in the form.

Trigger-binding configuration remains in `connections.json`. Connector Step
operation configuration is stored in the sibling non-secret
`use-configurations.json`, keyed by connector, connection, operation, Flow
type, and Step type. Writes accept only JSON Pointer paths declared by the
Flow definition. Applications load both files as a startup snapshot through
the Connector SDK; changing configuration requires an application restart.

### Project Connectors

Project mode owns configuration and OAuth in the project's Dex Server/Web.
The native Connectors page works from an exact AppManifest before any application
Release or Flow Definition exists. Runs and Flow operations retain their real
Flow Definition admission checks. The same precompiled server image interprets
checksum-verified connector manifests without connector-specific Go imports.

```yaml
web:
  workQueuePermissionMode: trusted-header
  trustForwardedEmbeddingHeaders: true
  connectorSetupEnabled: true
  connectorSetupMode: project
  connectorCacheDirectory: /var/cache/dex/connectors
  projectConfiguration:
    storageId: p0
    prefix: sv2-test
    projectId: a7k2
    scopeKind: live
    sessionId: ""
    kmsKeyId: arn:aws:kms:REGION:ACCOUNT:key/KEY
    allowUnencrypted: false
```

Supply `DEX_WEB_PROJECT_CONFIGURATION_ADMIN_TOKEN` through the workload secret
environment. Project and Preview Session identities are immutable startup
configuration. The trusted proxy supplies the authenticated `X-Dex-Actor-ID`,
public origin, mount path, and CSRF metadata. It must block the internal
AppManifest write and validation endpoints from browser routing.

Dex and application replicas use the same Go `sdkgo/projectconfig` package for
conditional, versioned storage. Immutable ordinary configuration contains logical
connection identities; private credentials remain in separately versioned objects.
Credential refresh and replacement take effect on the next Connector call.
Ordinary configuration changes require a new validated snapshot and deployment.
OAuth dispatch is admitted before the provider call and cannot replay after an
uncertain response or process restart.

See [Project configuration protocol](./PROJECT_CONFIGURATION.md) for the HTTP
contract, authority, retention, recovery, and integration commands. The new SDK
package and trigger schemas require published dependency releases before this
feature can be shipped as a standalone Dex image.

## Trusted reverse-proxy mounts

Dex Web can be mounted at a request-specific path below an authenticated host
application. Enable this only when port 8802 is reachable exclusively from the
trusted reverse proxy:

```yaml
web:
  trustForwardedEmbeddingHeaders: true
```

The equivalent environment variable is
`DEX_WEB_TRUST_FORWARDED_EMBEDDING_HEADERS=true`. The default is false. When it
is false, Dex rejects requests containing any forwarded embedding header.

The proxy strips client-supplied values, removes its public mount prefix before
forwarding, and injects exactly one value for each required header:

```text
X-Forwarded-Prefix: /apps/project-1/dex
X-Forwarded-Proto: https
X-Forwarded-Host: studio.example.com
X-Dex-Web-Embedded: true
X-Dex-Web-CSRF-Token: host-generated-token
```

`X-Forwarded-Prefix` is the browser-visible absolute path. It is `/` or a
canonical path without a trailing slash, query, fragment, authority, dot
segment, or encoded path separator. `X-Forwarded-Proto` and `X-Forwarded-Host`
are optional as a pair and identify the browser-visible origin. Dex uses that
origin and the forwarded prefix for OAuth redirect URIs. The protocol must be
`http` or `https`, and the host must contain no user information or path.
`X-Dex-Web-Embedded` accepts only `true` or `false`. The CSRF bootstrap token is
optional to Dex, but hosted deployments should provide a non-empty,
visible-ASCII value.

Embedded `trusted-header` Action and Display-edit mutations require exactly one
non-empty trusted `X-Dex-Web-CSRF-Token` and one matching browser `X-CSRF-Token`.
Missing, duplicated browser tokens or mismatches return
`403 WEB_MUTATION_CSRF_INVALID` before any Flow read or write. Malformed trusted
context, including duplicate context headers, is rejected earlier with `400`.
The trusted proxy must strip the browser's trusted context header and inject its
own authenticated session token.

Project embedding can supply `X-Dex-Connector-OAuth-Redirect-URI` to use one
authenticated host callback across Project and Preview mounts. Its only accepted
value is the canonical forwarded origin plus `/api/connector-oauth/callback`.
This requires project Connector mode, trusted-header permissions, embedded mode,
a non-empty CSRF context and authenticated `X-Dex-Actor-ID`. Untrusted or standalone
requests cannot select an override. The host must strip browser-supplied headers,
authenticate and bind callback routing to actor, original state and exact project
scope, then proxy the original callback query to `/api/v2/connector-oauth/callback`.
Dex stores the exact redirect URI in its durable OAuth seed and verifies it even
on completed retries. State, PKCE, admission, credentials and uncertain exchange
recovery remain owned by Dex. Without an override, native redirect construction
is unchanged. Real-provider browser validation is required before publication.

Dex injects the request-specific base path and presentation mode into the SPA.
The router, assets, navigation links, API calls, and recovery requests use that
path without sharing state between simultaneous mounts. OAuth completion
returns to that same mount instead of the internal proxy target. Embedded pages remove
redundant product chrome and allow same-origin framing. Standalone pages deny
framing. HTML is served with `Cache-Control: no-store` and varies on all three
presentation headers plus the public-origin pair.

For every browser method other than GET, HEAD, or OPTIONS, the SPA copies the
bootstrap token to `X-CSRF-Token`. The host proxy must validate that browser
header against the authenticated session before forwarding the request, then
strip it. Dex transports the token for the host boundary; it does not implement
host authentication, session management, or CSRF validation.

## Dynamic definition bundles

Local and blobstore sources support atomic bundles:

```text
<root>/
  active-manifest
  releases/<release-id>/**/*.json
```

`active-manifest` uses this strict schema:

```json
{
  "schemaVersion": "1.0",
  "releaseId": "550e8400-e29b-41d4-a716-446655440000",
  "bundlePrefix": "_superverse/dex-web/flow-definitions/releases/550e8400-e29b-41d4-a716-446655440000/",
  "bundleDigest": "sha256:<64 lowercase hex characters>",
  "definitionCount": 2
}
```

For a local source, `bundlePrefix` is
`releases/<release-id>/`. For blobstore it includes the configured root prefix as in
the example. Release directories are immutable: upload and verify every JSON
object before replacing `active-manifest`. Dex validates the UUID, exact
prefix, file count, every FDG, and the digest before installing a snapshot.

The digest input is the JSON files sorted by slash-separated relative path.
Each path and exact payload is framed as an unsigned 64-bit big-endian byte
length followed by those bytes; SHA-256 is computed over the concatenated
frames and encoded as lowercase `sha256:<hex>`.

A blobstore source reuses one existing S3 `blobStore.supportedStorages` entry:

```yaml
web:
  flowRenderingSource: blobstore
  flowRenderingBlobStore:
    storageId: p0
    prefix: _superverse/dex-web/flow-definitions
  workQueuePermissionMode: trusted-header
```

It conditionally reads the manifest by ETag on every definition-dependent
request and reuses only an unchanged, already validated snapshot. A changed,
incomplete, or invalid release returns 503 instead of serving the previous
catalog as current. Environment variables override YAML:

```text
DEX_WEB_FLOW_RENDERING_SOURCE
DEX_WEB_FLOW_RENDERING_DIRECTORY
DEX_WEB_FLOW_RENDERING_STORAGE_ID
DEX_WEB_FLOW_RENDERING_PREFIX
DEX_WEB_WORK_QUEUE_PERMISSION_MODE
DEX_WEB_START_FLOW_WORKER_TARGET_HEADLESS
DEX_WEB_TRUST_FORWARDED_EMBEDDING_HEADERS
```

`GET /api/flow-definitions` and `GET /api/v2/catalog` return the active revision
as `ETag`; the v2 catalog also returns `definitionRevision`. The browser sends
that revision as `X-Dex-Flow-Definition-Revision` for Search, Display, edits,
and Actions. A stale request receives `409 FLOW_DEFINITION_CHANGED`; the UI
reloads the catalog, clears stale operation state, and requires Action
confirmation again.

## Run through the Dex Server image

The `dex-server` Docker image embeds these production assets and starts Dex Web,
API, and Interpreter in one process by default. It listens for Web traffic on
port 8802 and FlowService traffic on port 8801.

Run only Web when it needs to scale independently:

```bash
docker run IMAGE --services web
```

Set `web.flowServiceTarget` in the mounted server YAML to the API service
address. Web starts even when that upstream is unavailable. `/healthz` reports
process liveness. `/readyz` validates the current definition snapshot and a
FlowService search, returning `definitionRevision`, source, and definition
count; `/api/*` returns an upstream error until FlowService is available. In project
configuration mode, `/readyz` checks versioned configuration storage independently
of an absent application FDG; Runs still requires its real FDG and FlowService.

To populate Web with a 90-execution Flow containing serial, fan-out, and fan-in
sections, run the [Large Step Graph demo](./demo/large-step-graph).
To exercise the widest layout, run the [90-way fan-out demo](./demo/fan-out-90),
which creates `Step1`, 90 parallel Steps, and no close-decision graph edges.

## Frontend development

Requirements are Node.js 22+ and a local `dexcli` build.

Terminal one starts the Go API bridge on port 8902:

```bash
./cli/dexcli dev --web-port 8902
```

Terminal two starts Vite with hot reload on port 8802:

```bash
cd web
npm install
npm run dev
```

Vite proxies `/api/*` and `/healthz` to `http://127.0.0.1:8902`.

## Build

```bash
cd web
npm ci
npm run check
npm run build
GOWORK=off go test ./...
```

Vite writes production assets to `assets/dist/`. `assets/embed.go` embeds that
directory into the Go module and ultimately into `dexcli`.

## Pages

The v2 list compiles typed filter controls into visibility queries,
loads current-run Summary RPCs with bounded concurrency, and displays Indexed
Attributes before ordered Summary fields. Selecting a run validates the Display
contract, supports inline edits for declared primitive fields, and renders
conditional none/object Actions beside the Flow Definition Graph.
Attribute-sourced Action inputs remain hidden. The UI condition is
presentational; Action RPCs must re-check current state.
Version 2 definitions use `uiSlot` for reusable display placement and expose
each Action's `requiredPermission` from the Go SDK Action registration.
User-sourced string Action inputs marked with `capture: "qr-code"` retain their
text field and add a **Scan QR code** button. The scanner is loaded only after a
user opens it, prefers the rear camera, and copies the decoded text into the
field without submitting the Action. Manual input remains available when the
camera is missing, denied, or blocked. Camera access requires HTTPS or localhost;
an embedding host must also allow camera access through its Permissions Policy.
Scanning does not grant an Action permission or bypass its condition check.

v1 pages live under `/v1/flows` and `/v1/rendering`. The Flows page provides Basic and Advanced visibility queries, pagination,
saved queries, configurable columns, Indexed Attributes, and timezone
preferences.

The Flow Rendering page displays the currently active source definition JSON. Its
legend independently filters control flow, WaitFor, RPCs, resources, SubFlows,
and diagnostics. Control flow, WaitFor, RPCs, Channels, Attributes, SubFlows,
and diagnostics start visible. Streams start hidden. Flow timeout handlers are
always visible as part of the Flow rather than a legend layer.

The Flow Definition renderer uses a compound layout separate from the runtime
Execution graph. The lavender Flow frame contains blue Step frames. Each Step
stacks orange WaitFor paths above its Execute decisions, with dispatch diamonds
for conditional returns. Channels occupy the upper-left resource rail,
Attributes share one box, RPC hexagons cross the Flow's left boundary, and
folded SubFlows occupy the right rail. Publishers point to Channels, Channels
point to consuming WaitFor paths, Attribute writers point to the Attribute box,
and the box points to readers. Channel and Attribute relations are hidden until
their resource or a related Step or RPC is selected. Resource and SubFlow
relations are dashed.
Transitions are solid; Execute-failure recovery is solid magenta.
Long labels wrap inside their shapes. Backward transitions and self-loops use
outer routing lanes. Select an edge to emphasize it and show its complete
condition beside the path; its endpoints and source location remain below the
canvas. The Mini Map starts collapsed. Flow timeout handlers use a compact
Step-like card with their timeout decision, rather than the RPC hexagon.
Viewport controls use visible Zoom In, Zoom Out, and Fit View labels. The
collapsed Mini Map uses a visible Show Mini Map button.
Each graph fits the complete definition into the viewport when it first loads
and after its visible layers change.

Flow Definition Graph 2.0 on **v1** Flow Rendering uses Process Canvas. **v2**
renders the same JSON with the Control Topology canvas. Version 1 continues to
use the original definition renderer on **v1**.

The graph contract, compound layout, React components, and styles live in the
shared [`flow-definition-renderer`](../packages/flow-definition-renderer)
package. Product docs import the same renderer for checked-in Python example
graphs.

The Run page remembers the last selected Overview, Execution graph, Timeline, or
Streams tab across browser refreshes. It automatically loads the complete semantic
history for the selected run. A continued-as-new run remains on screen until the
operator follows **Next run**; Dex Web never combines two runs into one graph or timeline.
Timeline and Execution graph show an animated loading indicator while waiting
for history. Empty states appear after loading finishes. Refreshing retains
events already on screen. The loading indicator respects reduced-motion settings.
The page also provides Live Flow State beside Selected event, Run input beside Identity,
attributes, timers, queued
steps, channels, completed outputs, stop, and time travel. Timeline and Execution graph keep
Selected event in the sidebar, where the critical-action **Review time travel**
entry opens the operation with that Step execution and its WaitFor or Execute
method already selected. Backend history IDs remain internal pagination and
correlation details. A Time Travel-created run includes a **TimeTravelFork**
event whose source run links back to the preserved history.
AttributeMap and ChannelMap instances with decimal-only names appear before
other instances and sort by numeric value in live state and event details.
Continued runs link to their previous run from Timeline and Execution graph.
Timeline connects each Step execution's first method event to the Flow start,
Flow continued, RPC, Step decision, or recovery event that scheduled it.
Selecting the first event reveals that source link; selecting a
WaitFor event also reveals its outgoing WaitFor-to-Execute link.
Execution graph nodes separate WaitFor and Execute with distinct colors, channel names, condition icons, and individual event details.
Selecting a Step execution emphasizes it in green, its previous Step in blue, its next Steps in orange, and their connecting arrows.
Close decisions remain in event details and do not create misleading Execution graph edges.
Large Execution graphs extend down the page at readable size. Fan-out ranks spread
horizontally and scale down to fit when possible, with a minimum one-third zoom.
Persisted Step decisions add planned graph branches. A selector-matched branch without a Step event appears Canceled with no execution ID.
SubFlow conditions appear as linked leaf nodes and compact WaitFor cards. Running
and terminal nodes display and link by their generated Flow ID. Original WaitFor
events retain the configured reuse policy; continue-as-new state retains only
the Condition ID and stable list position.
Methods interrupted by a forced close remain visible as Pending Timeline events
with their last persisted Scheduled or Started phase.
Timeline and Execution graph share structured event details for flow, step method, RPC,
and channel events. A Raw JSON tab preserves the complete server payload.
Successful Temporal RPC Updates appear as the same RPC events as result signals.
Blob-backed RPC input and output hydrate through the existing selected-event loader.
The Streams tab accepts a Stream name, reads its retained messages from the beginning,
and then continuously long-polls for the next message. Each message displays its creation
time and source. Stream retention is best effort, so older messages can be trimmed.
External attribute writes appear as Attributes updated events, with a
SetAttributes type label and the changed values in the event details.
Raw JSON shows hydrated values; missing retained data is labeled unavailable.
SYNC step Context shows the immediately preceding retry failure when available,
including its backend-native error, worker details, named and numeric gRPC
status, and an optional Worker-provided stack. Live Flow State shows the latest
pending failure on its matching active Step and expands that stack by default.
Selected event Context uses the same failure view with the stack collapsed.

### Reviewed local connector artifacts

Project mode normally accepts only checksum-verified official connector releases. An isolated Local Kind process may explicitly set `DEX_LOCAL_KIND=true` and `DEX_LOCAL_CONNECTOR_ARTIFACTS=/absolute/image-owned/authority.json`; server configuration additionally requires project mode and explicitly unencrypted local project storage. This does not enable a provider fixture or change provider endpoints. Never set either variable in hosted deployment manifests.

The descriptor has schema `connectors.dex.dev/local-artifacts/v1` and an `artifacts` array. Each entry contains `connectorId`, `modulePath`, absolute `directory`, the real published `baselineVersion`, `sourceCommit`, `sourceTreeDigest` and `artifactDigest` (`sha256:<hex>`). The existing local artifact loader verifies `connector-release.json`, its checksum file and optional UI bundle. Project admission additionally verifies the descriptor's exact artifact digest, module, baseline and source commit. Official downloads cannot declare local provenance; a descriptor never invents a published version.

Connections display local source and artifact identities. Configuration writes stamp a safe `localArtifact` pin from startup authority, never from browser input. Validation refuses an old configuration if that pin changed. The exact immutable configuration snapshot retains the pin. The application SDK separately requires the same image-owned authority and explicit local storage before accepting it; hosted applications reject it. This lets a reviewed unpublished connector schema be exercised with real providers without silently substituting a published artifact.

Source manifests and artifact generation receipts must accompany every local image. Compilation and artifact checksum validation do not establish real Stripe, Gmail, OAuth or application E2E acceptance.


### Hosted Start real-dependency validation

`make -C server hostedStartIntegTests` calls a running Dex Server/Web and the
unchanged formal Basic Process template v1.8.0 Worker. It verifies duplicate
start admission, same-operation recovery, changed operation identity, stale
Definition/target revisions, missing permissions, CSRF and browser Worker
selection rejection. Native Web display reads invoke the actual Worker view RPC;
its declared approval Action checks permission, CSRF and Definition revision before
invoking the real Worker. The test waits for durable completion and engine closure.
No Worker or backend API is replaced by a fixture.

Supply the service URL through `DEX_PROJECT_CONFIG_TEST_URL`, its actual Worker target
through `DEX_HOSTED_START_TEST_WORKER_TARGET`, and the fixed 64-character target
revision through `DEX_HOSTED_START_TEST_TARGET_REVISION`. The test operator also
supplies `DEX_PROJECT_CONFIG_TEST_PROJECT_ID` as the trusted CSRF context.
Persist `DEX_HOSTED_START_TEST_FLOW_ID` and `DEX_HOSTED_START_TEST_REQUEST_ID`
before the first invocation. On an application failure, inspect that Flow with
dexcli and reconcile external effects before time travel; keep these identities.
This direct trusted-service scenario does not assert the consuming platform's
BFF authentication or AWS application deployment acceptance.

The formal template's standalone REST API requires `process-<UUID>` identifiers;
it rejects Web's generated `flow-<UUID>` identifiers before calling its service.
Hosted Web verifies its own native display and Action path for the original FlowID.
The unchanged template REST path is not acceptance evidence for that identity.

The embedding packager requires committed source before writing release provenance.
It reads dependency versions from the Web and renderer source manifests. Its renderer peer is the exact declared stable version; runtime
dependencies, including QR scanning packages, remain ordinary package dependencies.
An embedding host may provide the used `react-router-dom` API through its framework
adapter. The router peer accepts that adapter's version; installation and compilation
against the actual host still require verification. Source reproducibility alone
does not establish consumer compatibility or hosted business acceptance.
