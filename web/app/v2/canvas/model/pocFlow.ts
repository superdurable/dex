 * this is total and never a guess. It is the axis view B is built on.
 *
 * `unknown` is the fifth value and it is not a Dex concept — it means the Step declares

   *                CompensateStep, which is ordinary saga structure and not a defect.
   *   dispatcher — failure-in >= 2, control out >= 1. Catches many AND resumes the flow. The book
