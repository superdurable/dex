 * converge on ONE node with a count rather than N nodes, and this model is shaped to make that the
 * easy thing: `runStateFor` rolls every execution of a StepType into one card's worth of facts.
 *
 * Kept in a separate file from `PocFlow` on purpose. Definition mode is the ABSENCE of an overlay,
 * not a run with every status nulled — a definition renders every possible path, and a graph where
 * every node reads "pending" would be a lie about what the artifact is.
