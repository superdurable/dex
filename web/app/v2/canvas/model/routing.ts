/**
 * WHAT SHAPE a Step's outgoing branches have, when they have one worth saying out loud.
 *
 * Two shapes exist in Dex and the drawing has until now told them apart nowhere at all:
 *
 *   ALL OF THEM  `goToMany` starts several Steps together. One decision, several targets.
 *   ONE OF THEM  several `goTo` decisions, each with its own guard. First match wins.
 *
 * Measured across the five fixtures: of the 14 steps with more than one possible next step, 13 take
 * ONE path and 1 takes ALL of them. So the fan is the EXCEPTION and is what gets marked; a step that
 * takes one path already declares itself by having a guard on every branch.
 *
 * The specs agree on where that distinction belongs, and it is not colour. UML 2.5.1 draws a fork as
 * "a short heavy bar" and rules that "the segments outgoing from a fork vertex must not have guards
 * or triggers"; a choice is a diamond with a guard on each outgoing edge. BPMN 2.0 §10.5.2 makes the
 * exclusive gateway's X marker OPTIONAL — "identical in meaning" either way — so the meaning cannot
 * have been living in the marker. Both put it on the NODE. Our data satisfies UML's rule for free:
 * the one fan-out has no guard, and every choice has exactly one guard per branch.
 *
 * THE SWITCH CASE. UML 2.5.1 §14.2.4.6 also gives the shorthand for our two big fans: when the
 * outgoing guards share a common left operand, "The left operand MAY be placed inside the
 * diamond-shaped symbol and the rest of the Guard expressions placed on the outgoing Transitions."
 * `book-volume`'s RecoveryGate is twelve branches of `target == <NAME>` and `ai-agent`'s CheckSteered
 * is seven of `input == <name>`; both satisfy the precondition exactly.
 *
 * WE HOIST BUT DO NOT PUT THE REMAINDER ON THE EDGES, which is where we part from the figure, and the
 * reason is our data. In both switches the case value NAMES ITS DESTINATION — `INIT` selects
 * `InitStep`, `continueRouteTool` selects `RouteTool` — so an edge labelled with it restates the card
 * it points at, and the line runs through the text besides. Naming the discriminant on the source card
 * is the half that carries information; the values stay in the panel with the guards.
 *
 * DETECTED BY SHAPE, NEVER BY COUNT. No surveyed product documents a branch count at which its
 * rendering changes — Step Functions, XState, n8n, Node-RED, Camunda and Graphviz all have none, and
 * the only numbers anywhere are capacity caps (Logic Apps 25 cases, Zapier 10 per group). So the
 * trigger is "do these guards all test the same name", which is a property of the flow rather than a
 * threshold somebody picked. It fires on exactly 2 of our 14 branching steps, and would improve a
 * two-branch switch just as much as a twelve-branch one.
 *
 * WHY THE RIGHT-HAND SIDE IS RESTRICTED to a single bare token, in `caseGuard` below: the shape test
 * has to reject expressions outright. `len(executions) == 0` looks like a case and is a call, and a
 * detector that accepted it would hoist source syntax onto a card — the exact leak the card's
 * no-expressions guard exists to catch.

 * A STRICT MAJORITY of the moving branches must agree, and at least two must. Both floors matter and
 * neither is arbitrary:
 *
 *  - Two, because one `X == V` beside one `X != V` is a yes/no test, not a switch, and hoisting a
 *    name over a pair of branches buys nothing. That is what keeps 11 of our 13 choosing steps
 *    untouched.
 *  - A majority, because the card names the discriminant and the edges answer it. RecoveryGate is
 *    11 of 12 and CheckSteered 5 of 7, so a non-conforming branch is a real case and the copy has to
 *    survive it — which is why the card says the path DEPENDS ON the name rather than claiming the
 *    name decides every path. The odd branch keeps whatever label it already had, and nothing on
 *    screen makes a claim about it.
