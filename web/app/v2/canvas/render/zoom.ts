 * Zoom is PURELY GEOMETRIC. It scales the picture and nothing else.
 *
 * There used to be a four-tier ladder derived from the zoom level, with hysteresis to stop it
 * strobing at a boundary. It is gone. Level of detail is now an explicit two-position control
 * (see `Detail` in `views/types.ts`), which is what nine surveyed products do — Copilot Studio
 * lists `Expand/Collapse` as toolbar item 1 and zoom as items 2-3, LangGraph puts detail on a
 * slider decoupled from the canvas, and n8n ties nothing to zoom but a single threshold for group
 * descriptions.
 *
 * What remains here is the two tricks that make a zoomed-out graph readable WITHOUT a tier,
 * both borrowed from n8n. They are better than a tier for the same reason: a tier change reflows
 * the graph, and these do not.
