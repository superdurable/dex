## Unreleased

### Breaking changes

- Removed push Workers and their inbound gRPC WorkerService listeners and lifecycle.
  Both Worker and AsyncWorker now always use pull Workers.
- Removed WorkerTarget (address, headless, and pull), Worker.worker_target,
  AsyncWorker.worker_target, WorkerOptions.bind_address,
  WorkerOptions.worker_target, ClientOptions.worker_target, and
  FlowConfig.worker_target. Delete these settings from applications, including
  StartFlowOptions and SubFlowOptions config overrides. Pull routing is automatic.
- WorkerOptions.pull now defaults to PullWorkerOptions() and no longer accepts
  None to select push mode. Retain it only to configure polling, task capacity,
  identity, registration, or shutdown.

Migrate to pull Workers, which need only an outbound connection to the Dex Server.
Remove inbound callback ports and Worker address advertisements. For active Flows
that still store a push target, call Client.update_flow_config with FlowConfig()
to route future handler calls to pull Workers; await the AsyncClient equivalent.
Start the Worker
and wait for wait_pull_registered before admitting work. This breaking change
ships in the next minor SDK release during Beta.
