# Dex Rust SDK

## Pending Channel messages

`Client::get_channel_messages` and `Client::get_channel_map_messages` return typed
`ChannelMessage<T>` envelopes in FIFO order. Deleting an already-consumed ID
returns `SdkError::ChannelMessageNotFound`.

An RPC can stage `channel.delete(context, message_id)`. Define it with
`Rpc::is_transactional()` when a missing ID must abort all other RPC writes.
Attribute locks already select transactional execution, while Channel deletion
requires the explicit option.

## RPC state loading

RPCs receive ordinary Attributes and all Channel size metadata by default.
AttributeMap entries and pending Channel messages are opt-in:

```rust
RpcList::new().procedure(
    Self::SNAPSHOT
        .load_attribute_map_instance(items.load("tenant-a"))
        .load_channel(&queued)
        .load_channel_map(&by_tenant),
    Self::snapshot,
)
```

Pass an AttributeMap or ChannelMap definition to its plural load method when
every current instance is needed. Use the singular instance methods for the less
common exact-instance case. A selected empty queue returns an empty vector;
reading an unselected map entry or pending-message snapshot returns a handler
error with type **dex_sdk::AttributeMapNotLoadedError**. An unselected pending-message
snapshot returns **dex_sdk::ChannelMessagesNotLoadedError**. Pending messages preserve FIFO
order and include the server-assigned message ID. The snapshot does not change
after the handler stages a publish or deletion.

Loading controls which data reaches the Worker. **is_transactional** controls
atomic commit and Channel deletion validation. Attribute locks add isolation
only among cooperating Steps and RPCs using the same lock. Write-only publish
and delete operations do not require loading.

## Step and timeout-handler state loading

`StepOptions` provides the same five selections independently for `wait_for` and
`execute`: all AttributeMap instances, exact AttributeMap instances, Channels,
all ChannelMap instances, and exact ChannelMap instances. The methods receive
independent snapshots. Execute reads after the winning Wait consumes messages;
retries of one logical method call reuse its first snapshot.

`FlowTimeoutHandlerOptions` provides Execute-style timeouts, heartbeat detection,
retry, durability, Attribute locks, and the same state selections. Set it on
`StartFlowOptions` or `SubFlowOptions` only for a positive timeout using
`FlowTimeoutPolicy::Handler`. Exhausted retries may proceed to a registered
`Step<Input = ()>`; read the final failure with `Context::recovery_error`.

[![Rust SDK CI](https://github.com/superdurable/dex/actions/workflows/sdk-rust-ci.yml/badge.svg?branch=main)](https://github.com/superdurable/dex/actions/workflows/sdk-rust-ci.yml)

This workspace contains the synchronous Rust SDK, the shared DXBC BlobCache,
and the generated Rust protocol used by the native bindings.

The crates are:

- `dex-sdk`: strongly typed synchronous Client, Worker, Flow, Step, RPC, and persistence APIs.
- `dex-blob-cache`: transport-neutral, Go-compatible disk cache.
- `dex-blob-cache-jni`: Java 8-compatible binding containing only cache APIs.
- `dex-blob-cache-python`: PyO3 binding for the Python SDK.
- `dex-blob-cache-node`: Node-API binding for the TypeScript SDK.
- `dex-protocol`: generated Rust protobuf and gRPC protocol.

The architecture is defined in
[Multi-language Rust SDK Core](../docs/design/multi-language-rust-sdk-core.md).
The public Rust API is defined in
[Rust SDK User Interface](../docs/design/rust-sdk-user-interface.md).

The `dex-sdk` source layout follows the application developer's mental model:
Flows, Steps, Attributes, Channels, Streams, RPCs, timers, and waits each have dedicated
modules. Client, Worker, Registry, and each options family are separated as
their own entry points instead of being collected into infrastructure-oriented
files. Handler failures and SDK/service failures are also separate modules.

Single-condition waits read as `Wait::until(condition)`. `Wait::all_of` and
`Wait::any_of` remain available for aggregate conditions. Client failures use
domain-specific `SdkError` variants such as `FlowNotFound`, `FlowNotActive`,
`FlowAlreadyStarted`, `RpcLockConflict`, and `WorkerInvocation` instead of
requiring callers to inspect transport metadata.

`Wait::until`, `Wait::all_of`, and `Wait::any_of` use unnamed Conditions by
default. Do not add Condition IDs merely because a Condition is nested in one
of these waits. `Wait::any_combination_of` requires a non-empty user ID on every
Condition; a cloned Condition retains its identity and may be reused across
combinations.

Client-side map reads and writes use `get_attribute_map_instance` and
`set_attribute_map_instance`. `Client::wait_for_attribute_equal` and
`Client::wait_for_attribute_map_instance_equal` target the current run and
accept only string, bool, integer, or double wire values. JSON, bytes, and null
return a local `InvalidArgument`. Every AttributeMap and ChannelMap instance must
be non-empty and must not contain `/`. `AttributeMap::map_size/all_instance_keys` include
buffered sets and deletes. The matching `ChannelMap` methods are RPC-only,
include buffered publishes, and omit empty instances. Keys are decoded and
sorted. Conditional completion is
`StepDecision::force_complete_if_channels_empty`.

`Client::wait_for_flow` and `wait_for_flow_with_timeout` return a
`FlowResult` after hydrating every output-bearing completion. Use the
strict helper for a single-output Flow:

```rust
let output: OrderResult = client.wait_for_flow(flow_id)?.single_output()?;

let result = client.wait_for_flow(flow_id)?;
for completion in result.completions() {
    if completion.step_type == "ChargeCard" {
        let receipt: Receipt = completion.decode()?;
    }
}
```

The completion slice preserves server collection order, but parallel branch
order is not deterministic. No-output Flows return an empty slice;
`single_output` returns `SdkError::InvalidArgument` for zero or multiple
completions. Every terminal status returns a `FlowResult`; inspect `status`,
`error_type`, and `error_message` for unsuccessful completion.

SubFlows are normal, independently addressable Flows used as durable Conditions:

```rust
fn wait_for(&self, _context: &mut Context, input: ChargeInput) -> HandlerResult<Wait> {
    let condition = SubFlow::run(&ChargeFlow::new(), input)
        .map_err(|error| HandlerError::new(error.to_string()))?;
    Ok(Wait::until(condition))
}

fn execute(&self, context: &mut Context, _input: ChargeInput) -> HandlerResult<StepDecision> {
    let receipt: Receipt = SubFlow::condition_result(context)?
        .single_output()
        .map_err(|error| HandlerError::new(error.to_string()))?;
    Ok(StepDecision::graceful_complete(receipt))
}
```

`SubFlow::flow_id_at(context, index)` remains available for a running `any_of` loser.
`SubFlowOptions` configures timing, timeout policy, retry, initial target Attributes,
Flow config, Condition ID, and reuse. Parent completion does not cancel an unfinished SubFlow.

Existing-Flow reads (`get_attribute`, `describe_flow`, `wait_for_flow`, and
`time_travel`) use `FlowNotFound`; operations requiring a running Flow use
`FlowNotActive`. Each remote variant owns a `ServiceError`, available through
`SdkError::service_error()`, with gRPC code, Dex sub-status, detail, operation,
Flow ID, and the original `tonic::Status` source. `WorkerInvocation` also owns
a `WorkerError` with the original worker code, type, and detail.

```rust
match client.publish(flow_id, &orders.approved, order_id) {
    Err(SdkError::FlowNotActive { service }) => {
        eprintln!("{} failed for {:?}", service.operation(), service.flow_id());
    }
    result => result?,
}
```

`Registry::register` reports invalid definitions as `SdkError::FlowDefinition`.
Value conversion and invalid Step results use `ValueMapping` and
`InvalidStepResult`.

### Soft Flow timeout

A Flow registers its optional handler through `timeout_handler`. Its presence
makes a positive timeout use handler policy by default:

```rust
fn handle_timeout(&self, context: &mut Context) -> HandlerResult<StepDecision> {
    notify_expiration(context)?;
    Ok(StepDecision::force_complete("expired".to_string()))
}

fn timeout_handler(&self) -> Option<FlowTimeoutHandler<Self>> {
    Some(Self::handle_timeout)
}

let options = StartFlowOptions::new()
    .timeout(Duration::from_secs(30 * 60))
    .timeout_policy(FlowTimeoutPolicy::Handler);
```

`Fail` produces `FlowErrorType::FlowTimeout` and permits Flow retry; `Cancel`
cancels without retry. Continue-as-new preserves the deadline and handler
execution, while retry runs receive a fresh budget. An absent or zero
timeout disables the feature.

## Rust SDK runtime

Flows bind their start input and every Step binds its own input at compile time:

```rust
use dex_sdk::{Context, Flow, HandlerResult, Step, StepDecision, StepList};

struct GreetingFlow {
    greet: Greet,
}

impl Flow for GreetingFlow {
    type StartInput = String;

    fn steps(&self) -> StepList<'_, Self::StartInput> {
        StepList::start(&self.greet)
    }
}

struct Greet;

impl Step for Greet {
    type Input = String;

    fn execute(
        &self,
        _context: &mut Context,
        name: String,
    ) -> HandlerResult<StepDecision> {
        Ok(StepDecision::graceful_complete(format!("Hello, {name}!")))
    }
}
```

`Client` calls block and return their final result. `Worker::start` serves until
another thread calls `Worker::stop`. Synchronous user handlers run on Tokio's
blocking executor, so they do not occupy gRPC I/O tasks. Long-running Step
handlers should emit heartbeats or Stream messages while polling
`Context::is_cancelled`. Cancellation becomes observable when the Worker
response stream closes.

### Step progress and Streams

WaitFor and Execute handlers can send progress before returning:

```rust
if let Some(checkpoint) = context.last_heartbeat_value::<Checkpoint>()? {
    resume_from(checkpoint)?;
}
context.record_heartbeat_value(Checkpoint::Saved { offset })?;
events.write(context, Event::Imported { offset })?;
context.record_heartbeat()?;
```

`record_heartbeat_value` persists a typed checkpoint for the next regular activity attempt.
`record_heartbeat` sends a heartbeat without a Value and clears the persisted details. A missing
Value and an encoded JSON null remain distinguishable by decoding `Option<T>`: the latter returns
`Some(None)`. Local activities transmit heartbeat frames but Dex ignores their values.

Each call blocks only when the Worker's single-frame output buffer is full. This bounded
backpressure preserves handler order without unbounded memory. `Stream::write` uses the same Step
response stream and may append repeatedly to the same Stream. It does not wait for a Stream Store
acknowledgment; storage rejection or failure is observable on Dex, not by the handler.
Flow timeout handlers and RPCs cannot send heartbeat or Stream progress.

Use an invocation-managed writer for text deltas:

```rust
let progress = THINKING.buffered_text(context)?;
progress.write(delta)?;
```

`buffered_text_with_options` accepts a `BufferedTextStreamOptions` interval and soft UTF-8 byte
threshold. Defaults are one second and 16 KiB. Invocation finalization sends the tail before the
final result or error. Empty buffers do not emit a message or heartbeat. Retry does not restore
unsent text or deduplicate emitted batches.

External writes remain unary. `Client::write_stream` requires a non-empty `source`, accepts `#`,
and appends every call even when a source repeats. Read messages return that metadata in
`StreamMessage::source`. Step writes use `#<stepExecutionID>`.

### Canceling Step executions

A successful Step can cancel queued or active executions while continuing with
its normal decision:

```rust
Ok(StepDecision::go_to(&self.record_quote, quote)
    .cancel_sibling_step(&self.carrier_a)
    .cancel_sibling_step(&self.carrier_b)
    .cancel_step(&self.global_quote_timeout))
```

`cancel_step` selects every current execution of one registered Step type.
`cancel_sibling_step` selects only executions whose
`Context::from_step_execution_id()` matches the current execution. Chain the
builders to select multiple types; Flow-wide selection wins for the same type.
The Worker rejects unregistered Step types as invalid results.

Dex resolves one snapshot after the current execution succeeds. Completed,
already-canceled, and absent targets are no-ops. Next Steps created by that
decision are outside the snapshot. Dex immediately applies the next or close
action; late decisions, writes, retries, and recovery Steps are discarded.

`RpcResult::cancel_step` provides Flow-wide selection for RPCs. RPCs do not
support sibling selection because they have no Step execution lineage.

Opt an Attribute or AttributeMap into Attribute Store synchronization and
select Server-configured Stores for the Flow:

```rust
use dex_sdk::{Attribute, FlowConfig};

let email = Attribute::<String>::new("customer-email").sync_to_attribute_store();
let config = FlowConfig::new().attribute_store_names(vec!["profiles".into(), "audit".into()]);
```

Stores are asynchronous latest-state projections. Every enabled Attribute write
is sent to every selected Store. Deletion writes SQL `NULL`, and projection
failures do not roll back Flow Attributes. Omitting the builder preserves
current targets; passing an empty vector disables future synchronization while
retaining protocol presence.

## Blob cache

The shared cache keeps opaque payload bytes on disk and uses Stretto only for
metadata admission and eviction:

```rust
use dex_blob_cache::{BlobCache, BlobCacheConfig};

let config = BlobCacheConfig::new("./blob-cache", 256 * 1024 * 1024, 10_000)?;
let cache = BlobCache::open(config)?;
let retained = cache.put("server-minted-blob-id", b"opaque bytes")?;
let cached_payload = cache.get("server-minted-blob-id")?;
if !retained || cached_payload.is_none() {
    // Keep using the freshly loaded bytes.
}
cache.close()?;
```

The calls are synchronous. Event-loop bridges must dispatch them through a
bounded blocking executor. Concurrent reads are supported; mutations and close
coordinate inside the cache. An orderly `close` does not delete committed
files, so they can be reused after restart; use `delete_all` before `close` for
ephemeral storage. The cache is not authoritative: policy rejection, a miss,
or a cache error must fall back to fresh server data.

Build the Java cache binding as an optimized native library:

```bash
cargo build --release -p dex-blob-cache-jni --locked
```

Build the Node cache binding and stage it into the TypeScript package:

```bash
cargo build --release -p dex-blob-cache-node --locked
# or from sdk-typescript:
npm run build:native
```

## Development

Rust 1.97 or newer is required.

Format and test the workspace:

```bash
make fmt
make lint
make test
make docs-check
```

`docs-check` denies missing rustdoc and rustdoc warnings for the hand-written
`dex-sdk` and `dex-blob-cache` public APIs, then compiles every documentation
example as a doctest. Generated protocol and language-binding crates are not
part of that public SDK surface. Generated HTML starts at
`target/doc/dex_sdk/index.html` and `target/doc/dex_blob_cache/index.html`.

Run the SDK integration suite against a fresh local `dexcli dev` stack:

```bash
./run-integration-tests.sh
```

The script creates its own Dex environment, ports, and BlobCache directory,
then removes the temporary state. Each Worker synchronizes its registered
Indexed Attributes before listening; failure or the default two-minute
deadline aborts startup.

### Measure integration coverage

Install `cargo-llvm-cov`, then run the same integration suite with Rust source
coverage:

```bash
cargo install cargo-llvm-cov --locked
./run-integration-tests.sh --coverage
```

Only the `integ` and `cross_sdk` integration test targets contribute execution
data. Test sources and dependencies are excluded from the report by
`cargo-llvm-cov`; coverage is reported for the production `dex-sdk` crate.

The LCOV report is written to `coverage/lcov.info`, and the browser report
starts at `coverage/html/index.html`. CI uploads the LCOV report with the
`sdk-rust-integration` flag and retains the full report as the
`sdk-rust-integration-coverage` Actions artifact.

## Releases

Publish `dex-sdk`, `dex-blob-cache`, and `dex-protocol` by creating a GitHub
Release whose tag is `sdk-rust/vX.Y.Z`. The release workflow stamps all crate
versions and internal registry requirements from the tag in its temporary
checkout, then publishes the crates in dependency order. No version-bump commit
is required before publishing.

The workflow also supports a manual validation run. Manual publishing is
restricted to `main` and requires the `CRATES_IO_TOKEN` repository secret.
