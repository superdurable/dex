Latency percentiles cover successful operations only. Errors counts failed measured operations, including timeouts. Load is closed-loop, so p99 and max understate queueing delay at saturation. Server CPU % is 100 per fully used core; host % is the share of all cores on that host. A point whose load host CPU exceeds 70% is marked invalid because the load generator may have been the bottleneck. channel-wake latency runs from PublishToChannel to Step Execute start; its throughput also includes the untimed Flow start and wait confirmation.
